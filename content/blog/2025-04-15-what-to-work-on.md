Recently I have been thinking about what I should work on. What is my goal in life? What I want to achieve?

During my Ph.D. I thought that at some point I should aim for a tenure track position. Think about what I care about, the type of research that I wanted to do, and guide my lab towards that goal. However, I made the transition from academia to industry, to get a taste of it. I discovered that really cool research can be made in industry. Nevertheless, not everything is color and rainbows. You can not decided what you work on, sometimes the decisions are not taken by you, and the research can also be boring.

But, there are so many other things to do in life that are not working. While in academia we have the laser focus ambition of not doing anything else apart from work, the ruthless pursue of excellence accounted by the number of hours you are working, we only have one life. And it ends, even when we are not expecting it. Thus, there must be a balance between how much you work, and how much your jobs asks for you, and doing other things in life. 

This means that deciding between a really interesting job, and an ok job that leave you a lot of time to do other stuff (like teaching, and not doing research) is actually really hard. There are so many people working on interesting things now, that if I am not doing novel things, I feel stupid. Then, what to do? I am not sure, but I need to decide something.
