### Hi there, I'm [Paco!](https://pacocp.es) ðŸ‘‹.
My name is Francisco (Paco) Carrillo-Perez, and I hold a Ph.D. in machine learning applied to bioinformatics from the University of Granada. I am working now as a freelance postdoctoral researcher in the Gevaert's lab at Stanford University.  I am mainly interested in multi-modal self-supervised learning and generative models for cancer research. In my spare time I like to climb, take long hikes, and read a good book!
