Lately I've been having a debate with myself.
In a lot of cases, I feel that I am pretty intentional with the things that I have in my life.
In areas like friendships, work or family, I just have what I need.
However, and because I have taken up a few hobbies and I had a bigger budget, I have been buying more material stuff.
I do not like this, and I would like to change that aspect of my life, or at least improve it.
There are multiple books about minimalism, and I have read quite a few of them:
- [Monk's Guide to a Clean House and Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35656221-a-monk-s-guide-to-a-clean-house-and-mind)
- [The Buy Nothing, Get Everything Plan: Discover the Joy of Spending Less, Sharing More, and Living Generously](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52213526-the-buy-nothing-get-everything-plan)
- [Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism)

However, I feel that I could be doing more, and that I am still buying a lot of things.
So I want to start my year of no buying things or, at least, "non-essential" things. 
This list of necessary things might change, but this is how I am going to start approaching this new idea.
Thins that I can buy:
- Food, cleaning supplies, everything of daily use.
- Eating at restaurants.
- Gifts for people.
- If I am travelling, I can buy something that would remind me to that place. 
- If something is really stopping me for doing things that I want, I can replace that.

I do not want to buy things that:
- I already have something that does the job.
- I do not want to upgrade the things that I have unless they are beyond repair.
- Bargains just because it is a good opportunity to buy them.

This will be my conditions to buy or not buy things.
They are pretty vague, but that is how I feel now.
Let's see how it goes.
